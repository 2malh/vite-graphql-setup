## Folder Structure

### src/css

Applications stylesheets should be placed here.

### src/components

Reusable components used throughout the application should be situated here.

### src/hooks

You should place your application hooks in this folder with the advent of [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/composition-api.html#composition-api) in Vue 3.

### src/pages

This folder contains your application pages.

### src/graphql

This folder contains everything regarding the graphql setup, queries, mutations and also files generated by [GraphQL Codegen](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) when you run `yarn codegen`

**src/graphql/queries**

Queries for each GraphQL types should be placed in here. Example, your GraphQL API has a **User** type and you need to write queries for that type, you should create a corresponding file **user.ts** and write your queries in the file/module.

**src/graphql/mutations**

The same convention that exists for GraphQL queries should be used for mutations also.
